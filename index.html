                <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
                <p>
                    Royal Challengers Bangalore, also known as RCB, is the Bengaluru-based cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The team is owned by United Spirits Limited, a Diageo Group company. RCB rose from a bottom-two finish in 2008 to end as runners-up in 2009 and semi-finalists in 2010. The team had 3 good seasons back-to-back when they made it to the final in 2011. Led by Virat Kohli, Royal Challengers Bangalore yet again finished 2nd in 2016. 

                    Under the able leadership of the Director of Cricket Operations Mike Hesson, Head Coach Sanjay Bangar, and captain Faf du Plessis, RCB made it to the playoffs in 2022; a feat that the team has now achieved for a third consecutive season. The squad consists of a fine blend of proven stars of the international arena and emerging talent. The international stars include the likes of Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, Dinesh Karthik, Glenn Maxwell, Wanindu Hasaranga and Josh Hazlewood, the team over the past few years has also nurtured and developed top domestic talents. Two outstanding fast bowlers, Harshal Patel and Mohammed Siraj have gone on to become a regular feature for Team India across different formats, while more recently Shahbaz Ahmed has earned a maiden national team call-up.
                    
                    RCB has adopted the philosophy #PlayBold which resonates both on and off the field - Defeats don’t defeat us, the Challenger Spirit keeps us alive'.

                <img class="gif" src="virat.jpeg" alt="">
                <h3>Virat Kohli</h3>
                <p>A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="char">
                <img class="gif" src="Faf Du plessis.jpeg" alt="">
                <h3>FAF DUPLESIS</h3>
                <p>Classy, composed and a fine crafter of innings', Faf du Plessis emerged as one of South Africa's most consistent batsmen in the post-Jacques Kallis era. Du Plessis is strong on the front foot, has impeccable defences and enjoys spending time at the crease. A natural leader, du Plessis was put in charge of the T20 side in February 2013 and formed part of the senior core in other formats.</p>

                <h3>AB de Villiers</h3>
                <p>de Villiers has risen through the ranks to become one of the world's finest batsmen, most versatile batsmen, across all formats. When on song, de Villiers has the ability to take any bowling attack apart with his wide array of strokes on either side of the wicket. If his orthodoxy is compact and aesthetically pleasing, the South African avant-garde's trailblazing innovation often rendered bowlers speechless.</p>

                <img class="gif" src="siraj.jpeg" alt="">
                <h3>Mohammed Siraj</h3>
                <p>An unknown quantity before the 2016-17 season, Mohammed Siraj, made a name for himself as he guided Hyderabad to a quarter-final finish in the Ranji Trophy, taking 41 wickets from nine matches and finishing as the third leading wicket-taker in the coveted tournament. A late bloomer as per Indian cricketing standards, Siraj took to serious cricket only in 2015.That effort brought him immense recognition and a place in the Sunrisers Hyderabad franchise for the 10th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).</p>

                <h3>Devdutt Padikkal</h3>
                <p>A lanky and stylish left-hander with a 6 '3 frame from Karnataka, Devdutt Padikkal oozes class and confidence. Devdutt was born in Edappal, Kerala, but his parents moved to Hyderabad when he was young before eventually settling in Bangalore, a move that was prompted by a promise of a better cricketing future for Devdutt in Bangalore. He started the sport at the age of 11 and slowly laddered up the ranks of school and age-group cricket to carve a niche for himself.</p>

                <h3>
                    Yuzvendra Chahal</h3>
                <p>Born in Haryana, Yuzvendra Chahal is a fine right-arm leg-spinner, who made his first-class debut at the age of 19 in an away game against Madhya Pradesh at Indore. Though he has not played many first-class games, he has been impressive in the shortest format and it also earned him an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians in 2011.</p>

                <h3>Dinesh Karthik</h3>
                <p>Dinesh Karthik was one of the plethora of wicketkeepers tried out by India in the Ganguly era of Indian cricket before the arrival of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Nevertheless, having been in and out of the Indian team and in the limited opportunities he's had, he has performed admirably behind the stumps as well as with the bat.</p>

                <h3>Glenn Maxwell</h3>
                <p>With the Sehwag-esque ability to enthrall as well as exasperate, Glenn Maxwell blurred the line copy-book and agricultural, pulling off unorthodoxy with ease and fluency. Making use of his athleticism and quick responses, Maxwell revolutionized the modern limited-overs game with the ability to let his instincts guide his responses to the ball. The twist is that the said response may not necessarily be a shot that has ever been witnessed on a cricket field.</p>
